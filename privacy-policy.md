Privacy Policy for SingLong

Last updated: February 2026

SingLong respects your privacy. This app is designed to function without collecting or storing personal data.

Information Collection and Use
SingLong does not collect, store, or share any personal information.
The app uses the device’s microphone (RECORD_AUDIO) solely to enable singing and audio-related features. Audio input is processed locally on the device in real time. No audio recordings are saved, stored, or transmitted outside the device.

Data Sharing
SingLong does not share any user data with third parties.

Third-Party Services
SingLong does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
Optional donation links (Liberapay, Stripe, and PayPal) are provided externally. Any information shared with these services is governed by their respective privacy policies and occurs outside the app.

Data Security
Because SingLong does not collect or store personal data, there is no retained user data to secure.

Children’s Privacy
SingLong does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
This policy may be updated if the app’s functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected on this page.
